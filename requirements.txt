Technical Assignment - Web Frontend
Overview
Build a production-ready image uploader in React using Uppy's headless/core API with a
completely custom UI. The solution should demonstrate your ability to work with third-party
libraries at a low level while creating a polished, responsive user experience.
Key Constraint: You must use Uppy in headless mode (core only) - no pre-built UI components
like Dashboard, DragDrop, or ProgressBar. Build all the UI from scratch.
Core Requirements
1. Uppy Headless Integration with Cloudinary
● Use @uppy/core for file handling and state management
● Use @uppy/xhr-upload configured for Cloudinary's upload endpoint
● Use @uppy/thumbnail-generator for client-side image previews
● Subscribe to Uppy events for progress tracking and thumbnail generation
● Do NOT use: @uppy/dashboard, @uppy/drag-drop, @uppy/progress-bar, or
any other UI plugins
2. Custom React Dashboard
Build a complete custom UI that includes:
● Drop Zone: Custom drag-and-drop area with visual feedback for drag states
● File Selector: Click-to-browse with proper file input handling
● Mobile Support: "Upload from Gallery" button on mobile devices
● File Queue: Display pending, uploading, completed, and failed files
● Action Buttons: Upload all, Cancel, Retry failed, Clear completed
3. Progress Tracking
Implement comprehensive progress visualization:
Per-File Progress:
● Progress indicator for each file
Overall Progress:
● Aggregate progress bar for all files
● Files completed / total files count
● Total bytes uploaded / total bytes
● Estimated time to complete (bonus)
4. Masonry Layout for Previews (Pinterest style)
Display image previews in a responsive masonry grid using thumbnails from
@uppy/thumbnail-generator:
● Images should flow naturally based on their aspect ratios (thumbnails preserve aspect
ratio)
● Responsive columns: 1 column (mobile), 3 columns (desktop)
● Smooth layout transitions when images load or are removed
● Each image card should show:
○ Thumbnail preview
○ File name
○ Upload status indicator (pending/uploading/complete/error)
Implementation options: CSS columns, CSS Grid, or any available library
5. File Validation
● File Types: Only accept images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp)
● File Size: Maximum 10MB per file
● Show clear, user-friendly error messages for validation failures
6. UI States
● Empty: Clear call-to-action, visually appealing drop zone
● Hover: Visual feedback when hovering over drop zone
● Drag Active: Distinct state when dragging files over the zone
● Uploading: Progress indicators
● Success: Clear confirmation with Cloudinary URL
● Error: Error messages with retry option
Technical Requirements
Must Use
● React 18+ with functional components and hooks
● @uppy/core (headless only)
● @uppy/xhr-upload for uploads to Cloudinary
● @uppy/thumbnail-generator for client-side image previews
● CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, or styled-components
Cloudinary Setup
This assignment uses Cloudinary for direct browser-to-cloud uploads without requiring a
backend, you can create a free account at https://cloudinary.com
Performance Considerations
● Memory Management: Clean up when files are removed, and properly dispose Uppy
instance on unmount
● Thumbnail Generation: Handle the async nature show loading state until preview is
ready
● Error Boundaries: Implement error boundaries to prevent crashes
● Concurrent Uploads: Configure appropriate upload concurrency
● Lazy Loading of thumbnails
Deliverables
1. Source Code (GitHub repository)
● Well-organized component structure
● Clear separation of concerns
2. Documentation
● README with setup instructions
● Architecture decisions explained
3. Demo
● Screen recording showing all features
● Live demo link (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) preferred

Bonus Points (Optional)
● Unit Tests: Tests for custom hooks and utilities
● E2E Tests: Playwright or Cypress tests for upload flow
● Animations: Smooth transitions, skeleton loaders, micro-interactions
● Camera Capture: Option to capture from camera on mobile
Submission
● Share a GitHub repository link with your code
● Include clear instructions for running locally
● Provide Cloudinary setup instructions
● Include a live demo link if possible
